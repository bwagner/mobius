###### Drum Fills (script) Comments ######
### How I use it: 
# 1) Record x number of cycles worth of drums on any given track on Loop 1, be sure to bind this script to your designated drum Track
# 2) Pressing first time will give you a quick 2-cycle measure to record a fill on Loop 2, automatically returns to Loop 1
# 3) "   " for Loop 3
# 4) "   " for Loop 4
# 5) Any press after that will play the previously recorded "fills", lending variety to your live performances!
### add as many loops as you'd like, just be ready to adjust the code accordingly
### slipForward is used to "make up" for the lost time when a fill is executed and then restored upon returning to Loop 1
### I couldn't find a way to queue a fill on the last cycle without issues, so it is passed for the time being

###### Preset Settings
### These are the ones that work best for me, but feel free to experiment
# Empty Loop Action: None
# Switch Location: Restore
# Switch Duration: Permanent
# Return Location: Restore
